                <h2>Welcome</h2>    
                <p>Growing up in the South, I've always been a fan of food.  From fried chicken and mashed potatoes, to country-fried steak with sausage gravy, there's just something about Southern cooking that screams comfort. I’ve also trained in classical French cooking, absorbing various techniques that are applicable to just about any recipe.</p>

                <p>After years of working in restaurants, I decided to step away from the long hours and equally long nights to focus more on my family.  However, my passion for cooking still remains. Here you will learn professional cooking tips, as well as some of my favorite recipes from over the years.</p>
